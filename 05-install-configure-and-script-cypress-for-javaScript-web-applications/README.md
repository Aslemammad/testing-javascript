# install, configure, and script Cypress for JavaScript web applications

1. Install and run Cypress

   Once Cypress is installed in a project, we can run it with:

   ```bash
   $ npx cypress open
   ```

   This generates a number of tests and files in `./cypress` folder, including
   a folder for end-to-end tests, fixtures, plugins, and support.
